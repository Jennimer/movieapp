## Description

A Movie App in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript. The app fecth data from The Finnkino APi and display movie info on the user's screen. In this project I learned about how to use the third-party APIs, how to get the data from the API, how to convert this data into JSON format, how to implement JSON data into the DOM with the help of javascript. The hardest part was to find right information from different XLM -arrays.
